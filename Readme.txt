How It Works:
Comments: The list of 25 warranty comments is displayed in the comments section, each represented by a draggable card.
Groups: Players can create new groups to sort similar comments and add labels to those groups.
Drag-and-Drop: The player can drag comments into different groups.
Done Button: Once the player is done grouping and labeling, they click the "Done" button, which logs the groupings and labels in the console.
This simulation provides a basic affinity diagram creation experience.
